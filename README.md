# Random-Password-Generator
The app features autogenerating password, user have all the controll over length and type of character
This version is including listing passwords option
we take intented size of the list that need to be generated 
Inside an custom dialog I added an recycler view that the generated list is passed 
than add an image click listener that we get the position of the recycler item 
Than we copy the poition index of the value to clipboard in the list

tha save option currently not imolemented!
